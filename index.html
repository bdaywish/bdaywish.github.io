            Hey Shreya, thank you for being there and thank you for your constant support. You've been there for me whenever I needed you. Whenever I felt low, you were there to lift me up. You're such an amazing person. Stay the same. Keep growing into an amazing woman. You're precious. I'll never fail to make you realize your worth. You and I are really have so much in common, we both love shopping, & we both love Stefan. There are so many things. I miss you so much. Once this lockdown will get over you're the first person I'm gonna meet. I'm sorry I won't be there on your birthday. But, I'll try my best to make it a special one for you. I want you to be happy always. May you always keep getting more beautiful. Keep sending me the voice messages. I love hearing them. I love your voice. Happy Birthday, Shreyu. Lots of love. ‚ô•Ô∏è</p>
